San Andreas Multiplayer Client-Sided Anti-Cheat
-------

An anti-cheat engine built from the ground up in mostly Java, with some back end in C++, and PHP. This was created and maintained by Whitetiger. It has kept A/D matches in SA-MP protected from various cheats for over 2 years. It is the only currently updated, viable client-sided anti-cheat that I am aware of for any public server. it is constantly evolving and expanding on new techniques. On our website, it has a total of 15,000 downloads. It has protected ESL (Electronic sports league) from cheaters in SA-MP, and now it's open source.
